## 🎯 Introduction
Regulatory reporting in the banking sector involves compiling vast amounts of data to meet
compliance requirements.
Data profiling is a critical part of this process, ensuring that reported data aligns with regulatory
requirements.
Traditionally, this process is manual and time-consuming. This solution automates data profiling
using Generative AI (LLMs) and unsupervised machine learning

## 💡 Inspiration
Manual data profiling is labor-intensive and prone to human error. Automating this process using AI
reduces errors, increases efficiency, and ensures compliance with complex regulatory requirements.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- Generates profiling rules based on transaction data and banking regulations.
- Calculates adaptive risk scores using unsupervised machine learning techniques.
- Detects potential violations and suggests remediation actions using a chatbot.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- Backend: Java Spring Boot (Gradle) with RESTful APIs.
- Frontend: React.js with state management.
- Profiling Engine: LLM-based rule generation and risk scoring.
- Chatbot: Suggests remediation actions based on profiling results

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
- Handling large transaction data efficiently.
- Defining accurate profiling rules.
- Generating meaningful remediation suggestions using LLMs.
